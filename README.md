# Python-Coursework
Throughout this course, I will be writing a significant amount of code, which I will document here. I believe that documenting my work offers two main advantages: it will encourage me to maintain a high standard of quality and serve as a valuable reference for revisiting concepts later in my career. Each file will be accompanied by a brief description for clarity.

## [Bank-App-Project](bank-app-project)
(Project still in Progress) This project is the first client/server App I will create. At the moment the "database" is just a Python dictionary, but it will eventually be connected to a real database. One of the major takeaways from this project is taking a modular approach. Instead of focusing on just the functionality of the code, I am also being mindful of readability and maintenance. This is a great first project to learn industry practice.


## [IntgerSums](integersums.py)
As I reviewed some Python basics, my professor provided some practice problems to help me get back into the flow of programming. I was able to complete this problem without any external resources. However, I learned a lot about more efficient ways to simplify this code.


## [DiceRollSim](DiceRollSim)
Following along in class with my professor as he covered some basics. A takeaway from today was the idea that projects (especially large-scale ones) should be split into different files. 


## [SQL-Queries](SQL-Queries)
Some practice problems to get back into the flow of SQL queries. This practice was a good refresher on multiple table joins and subqueries.
