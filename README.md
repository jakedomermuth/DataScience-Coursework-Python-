# Python-Coursework
Throughout this course, I will be writing a significant amount of code, which I will document here. I believe that documenting my work offers two main advantages: it will encourage me to maintain a high standard of quality and serve as a valuable reference for revisiting concepts later in my career. Each file will be accompanied by a brief description for clarity.

## [IntgerSums](integersums.py)
As I review some Python basics, my professor provided some practice problems to help me get back into the flow of programming. I was able to complete this problem without any external resources. However, I learned a lot about more efficient ways to simplify this code.
